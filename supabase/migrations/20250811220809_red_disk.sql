  # Fix news permissions for anonymous users

  1. Security Updates
    - Allow anonymous users to insert, update, and delete news
    - This is for demo purposes - in production you'd want proper authentication
    
  2. Changes
    - Update RLS policies to allow anonymous operations
    - Keep read access public
